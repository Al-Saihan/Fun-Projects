# Small Fun Projects!

A small collection of web projects made by me.

## Projects

### Fortune Generator
- Description: Get a random fortune for your day, with options to customize the fortune box's appearance.

### Stopwatch
- Description: A simple stopwatch that counts time in multiples of 3 seconds, and stops at 30 seconds.

### To-Do List
- Description: A to-do list application that allows users to add, track, and delete tasks. Data is stored using localStorage.

## Notes
- All projects are client-side and require no build steps.
- For persistent task storage, the To-Do List uses the browser's localStorage.
